Postdoc at the <a href='https://geometry.stanford.edu/'>Geometric Computation group</a> led by Prof. <a href='https://profiles.stanford.edu/leonidas-guibas'>Leonidas Guibas</a> in Stanford. Research interests include <i>3D graphics, 3D computer vision and robotics</i>. 

Interested in new and cool things, and wanted to figure out everything beneath a particular technique.

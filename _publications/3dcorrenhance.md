title: "Multiview Equivariance Improves 3D Correspondence Understanding with Minimal Feature Finetuning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/3dcorrenhance
excerpt: "
This work evaluates and improves the 3D awareness of Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, showing that enhancing 3D equivariance in their semantic embeddings leads to better performance in tasks like pose estimation and tracking. The authors propose a simple finetuning strategy based on 3D correspondences, demonstrating substantial improvements with minimal finetuning on a single object."

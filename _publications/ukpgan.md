title: "UKPGAN: Unsupervised KeyPoint GANeration"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/ukpgan
excerpt: 'in this work, we reckon keypoints under an information compression scheme to represent the whole object. Based on this, we propose UKPGAN, an unsupervised 3D keypoint detector where keypoints are detected so that they could reconstruct the original object shape. Two modules: GAN-based keypoint sparsity control and salient information distillation modules are proposed to locate those important keypoints. Extensive experiments show that our keypoints preserve the semantic information of objects and align well with human annotated part and keypoint labels.'

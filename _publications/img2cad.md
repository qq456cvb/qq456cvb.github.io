collection: publications
permalink: /publications/img2cad
excerpt: 'Img2CAD introduces a novel approach for reconstructing 3D CAD models from single-view images. Leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) like GPT-4V for semantic guidance, and TrAssembler, a transformer-based network, for continuous attribute prediction, our method achieves accurate and editable CAD outputs from common image inputs. We also provide a newly curated dataset, CAD-ified from ShapeNet, covering diverse everyday objects.'

title: "CPPF++: Uncertainty-Aware Sim2Real Object Pose Estimation by Vote Aggregation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/cppf++
excerpt: 'Object pose estimation is crucial in 3D vision, but real-world data collection is costly. This paper presents CPPF++, a new sim-to-real pose estimation method using only 3D CAD models. CPPF++ enhances the point-pair voting scheme with probabilistic modeling to address voting collision and iterative noise filtering. We introduce N-point tuples for richer voting context and a new dataset, DiversePose 300, to test current methods in diverse scenarios. Our results show CPPF++ significantly reduces the gap between simulation and real-world performance.'

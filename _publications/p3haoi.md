permalink: /publications/p3haoi
excerpt: 'Embedding Human and Articulated Object Interaction (HAOI) in 3D is crucial for understanding human activities. Unlike previous works using parametric and CAD models, we propose a novel approach using 3D geometric primitives to encode both humans and objects. In our paradigm, humans and objects are compositions of primitives, enabling mutual information learning between limited 3D human data and various object categories. We choose superquadrics as our primitive representation for their simplicity and rich information. We introduce a new 3D HAOI benchmark with primitives and their images and propose a task for machines to recover 3D HAOI from images. Additionally, we provide a baseline for single-view 3D reconstruction on HAOI, paving the way for future 3D HAOI research.'

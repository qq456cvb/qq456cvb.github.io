title: "Canonical Voting: Towards Robust Oriented Bounding Box Detection in 3D Scenes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/canonical
excerpt: 'In the work, we disentangle the direct offset into Local Canonical Coordinates (LCC), box scales and box orientations. Only LCC and box scales are regressed while box orientations are generated by a canonical voting scheme. Finally, a LCC-aware back-projection checking algorithm iteratively cuts out bounding boxes from the generated vote maps, with the elimination of false positives. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging large-scale datasets of real point cloud scans: ScanNet, SceneNN with 11.4 and 5.3 mAP improvement respectively.'

title: "Bridging the Gap between Human Motion and Action Semantics via Kinematic Phrases"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/motionkp
excerpt: "Motion understanding aims to map motion to action semantics, but the variability in both makes this challenging. Abstract actions like 'walk forwards' can be conveyed by diverse motions, while a single motion can have different meanings depending on context. Previous direct-mapping methods are unreliable, and current metrics fail to consistently assess motion-semantics alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Kinematic Phrases (KP), which abstractly and objectively represent human motion with interpretability and generality. Using KP, we unify a motion knowledge base and build a motion understanding system. KP also enables Kinematic Prompt Generation (KPG), a novel benchmark for automatic motion generation. Experiments show our approach outperforms others, and we plan to release our code and data publicly."

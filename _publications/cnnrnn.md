collection: publications
permalink: /publications/cnnrnn
excerpt: 'We propose a deep learning approach for directly estimating relative atmospheric visibility from outdoor photos without relying on weather images or data that require expensive sensing or custom capture. Our data-driven approach capitalizes on a large collection of Internet images to learn rich scene and visibility varieties. The relative CNN-RNN coarse-to-fine model, where CNN stands for convolutional neural network and RNN stands for recurrent neural network, exploits the joint power of relative support vector machine, which has a good ranking representation, and the data-driven deep learning features derived from our novel CNN-RNN model.

title: "Rodrigues Network for Learning Robot Actions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/rodrinet
excerpt: "
This work introduces the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical Rodriguesâ€™ rotation formula, to embed kinematic inductive bias directly into neural networks. Built upon this operator, the proposed Rodrigues Network (RodriNet) effectively models articulated actions and significantly improves performance across tasks like forward kinematics prediction, imitation learning for robot manipulation, and 3D hand pose estimation from images.

title: "Pytorch Implementation of Various Point Transformers"
collection: sideprojects
permalink: /sideprojects/pointtrans
excerpt: 'Recently, various methods applied transformers to point clouds: PCT: Point Cloud Transformer (Meng-Hao Guo et al.), Point Transformer (Nico Engel et al.), Point Transformer (Hengshuang Zhao et al.). This repo is a pytorch implementation for these methods and aims to compare them under a fair setting. Currently, all three methods are implemented, while tuning their hyperparameters.'

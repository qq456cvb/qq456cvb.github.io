title: Cycle-W-GAN
collection: sideprojects
permalink: /sideprojects/cyclewgan
excerpt: This is a Tensorflow implementation of the famous Cycle-GAN described in the paper <em>Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks</em>. I modified it by add Wasserstein distance to make the training more stable.

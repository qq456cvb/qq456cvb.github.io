title: "Pytorch implementation of Sketch-WGAN"
collection: sideprojects
permalink: /sideprojects/sketch
excerpt: 'This is a Pytorch implementation of the paper <em>A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings</em>. I use WGAN to mimic the data distribution of sketch drawings, where the key difference from the original sketch-rnn is in the reparameterization of GMM.'

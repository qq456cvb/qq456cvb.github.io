excerpt: 'This is a Tensorflow (v1) implementation of <em>Trust Region Proximal Optimization</em> method. It is purely build on Tensorflow (v1)graphs and encapsulated as a seperate optimizer. You only need to pass the policy function and the cost function to the optimizer and create the cache variables.'

title: "Pytorch implementation of adversarial autoencoders"
collection: sideprojects
permalink: /sideprojects/aae
excerpt: 'This repo implements the adversarial autoencoders (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05644.pdf), and reproduced the results on MNIST. One difference is that I used Wasserstein distance instead of naive GAN loss.'

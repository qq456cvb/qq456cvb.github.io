title: "RealTimeTrack: A fast algorithm tracking real time deformable planers"
collection: sideprojects
permalink: /sideprojects/track
excerpt: 'This is part of my graduation design. It can track multiple deformable images at the same time at a FPS above 30. The idea is based on the paper <em>Template-based Monocular 3D Shape Recovery using Laplacian Meshes </em> but with some performance improvements.'
